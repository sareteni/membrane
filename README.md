Final project for Spring 2023 DXARTS472

Description of animatronic sculpture: A shiny white plastic box hangs on the wall. The surface facing the audience has patches of small hairs sticking out of it. Audio plays of a person inhaling and gently blowing. This is to suggest someone gently blowing on skin. The hairs on the surface raise up in goosebumps across the face of the box, before disappearing while the hair on the surface moves slightly. This repeats on loop.

Skin is an intimately human organ, an entire sense with which to percieve the world, and also a barrier that seperates the intside from the outside. The project's concept is blurring the lines between the organic and inorganic. This idea envisions a future where humans can merge with machines, augmenting their biological limitations and achieving unprecedented levels of physical and cognitive abilities. Usually when this idea is examined, it focuses on the human aspects and consequences. I wanted to explore what transhumanism might mean for the machine. 

The project is made with electronics, acrylic, and faux stretch leather. Acrylic forms the shell of the box and the stetch fabric forms the "skin". For the hairs on the surface, I used string and plastic bumps to create the goosebumps. Three servo motors raise and lower small platforms to create the subtle movement of the "hair". A different box plays the audio through speakers. The audio box has the lower half of a female face appearing to be coming out of the box. The face focusing on the mouth reinforces the idea of blowing on skin.
